const mongoose = require('./index');

// const activitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({

//   score: Number,
//   active_calories: Number,
//   average_met_minutes: Number

// Initial idea was to store this in DB
// However makes much more sense to just call API and then store calculations of averages or access tokens in DB
